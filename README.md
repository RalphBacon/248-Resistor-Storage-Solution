# #248 Resistor Storage Solution
How to store through-hole resistors in an efficient manner?

Also a quick update on the 8-bit shift register (with latch) project I'm working on to show error states in our Arduino projects.

### How can we store through hole resistors in an efficient way? Easy.

You can use a test tube. Just roll the resistors up (demoed in the video) and put them in the test tube. I have quite a lot of resistors so I used 30mm testtubes but there are cheaper ones that are a bit smaller.

I show you how I label them too, and to keep the lid with the correct test tube! 

Plenty to choose from, so do your research!
